# OneDriveUploader
So... have you ever tried to upload a large amount of files to OneDrive? No? Well, lucky you.
If you try to do this in a normal way, like with Chrome, it will fail sooner or later.
I don't like very much things that don't work... so I'm writing this little program to help me to help OneDrive.
It will divide the files to uploads in smaller groups and it will add some basic I/O features, like folder merging, overwrite file and skip file.
The program is still in an early stage of development... but if you want to help me and/or send me a suggestion you're welcome.
Enjoy.
